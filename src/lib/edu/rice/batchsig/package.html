<h1>Batch signature code</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This code layers on top of the history tree and
Merkle tree libraries in edu.rice.historytree and offers an asynchronous
queu interface for checking and verifying signatures.

<p>The main classes
for signing messages are: HistoryQueue, MerkleQueue, and SimpleQueue. These clases sign submitted messages with Spliced signatures, Merkle signatures and Simple signatures respectively.
They are interchangable and support the ProcessQueue interface, where messages can be
submitted for signing. Messages to be signed must implement the OMessage interface. 

<p>The main class for verifying messages is VerifyQueue, where messages
are submitted for verification. This code is only somewhat lazy, in that
all outstanding messages are verified instantly upon a call to
process(). It handles all types of signature, dispatching the verification duties to 3 helper classes.
VerifyHistTreeGroup/VerifyHisttreeSingle, VerifyMerkle, and
VerifySimple. Messages to be verified must support the IMessage interface.

<p> All public key signature operations are done through an opaque interface SignaturePrimitives.
