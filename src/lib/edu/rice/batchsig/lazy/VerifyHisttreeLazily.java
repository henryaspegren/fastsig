/**
 * Copy of verifyqueuelazy, which takes loginlogout hints and tries to delay
 * signature verification for spliced signatures.
 * 
 * Messages are only lazily verified, when explicitly forced.
 * 
 * When a public key signature is verified, that verification can validate both
 * that one message, and earlier messages through the transitive closure of
 * verified splices.
 * 
 * Lets say that message M is forced, we could check the signature on M, which
 * will validate M. M might have valid splices to prior messages, spliced to yet
 * other messages. With one public key verification on M, we can validate those
 * prior messages through very cheap hash operations on spliced signatures.
 * 
 * This is not ideal. What would be more efficient would be to look for a later
 * message P whose transitive closure of splices includes M, then by validating
 * P, we validate many more messages through cheap hash operations.
 * 
 * How to find P?
 * 
 * Algorithm 1: Use Union-Find.
 * 
 * Each group is a set of messages which can be validated by verifying the
 * exlempar element's single public key signature. (This means that validate the
 * signature splices BEFORE merging into a group).
 * 
 * Given a new message M, the cases are:
 * 
 * If an existing message in a group includes a splice to M, validate the splice
 * and add M to the group. If M includes a splice the exlempar element of a
 * group G, validate the splice and M becomes the exlempar of that group. If M
 * includes a splice to the exlempar elements of several groups, validate the
 * splices and M becomes the exlempar of the union of the groups.
 * 
 * PROBLEM: Not robust to signature validation failures.
 * 
 * Algorithm 2: Store the entire graph
 * 
 * Store a dag. Nodes in this dag correspond to messages, and edges correspond
 * to splice points. Some nodes in this graph can be 'incomplete', meaning that
 * we've not seen.
 * 
 * either actual message, or 'stub' messages.
 * 
 * NOT multithread safe.
