<h1>History tree storage</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Our history tree and Merkle tree operate do not operate on their
binary trees directly. Rather, they interface to their 'data store' via
an opaque interface. This code code implements several data storage
backends with different time/space/performance tradeoffs, including one
that stores nodes consecutively in an array, and one in a hash table.

<p>We need multiple kinds of stores. An Array based store is best
when building complete binary trees, and every node is stored. A hash store is
better when generating sparse pruned trees.

<p>History trees support a special kind of linear access that allows
us use a lighter weight store when building them, the
AppendOnlyArrayStore, which does not work for Merkle trees.
